# Weights Directory

You can use this directory to store model weights files that are used by the `inference.py` script.

To use the same weights that were used in the OCELOT submission:

1. Download the tissue model weights from [here]()
2. Place them in this directory with the filename `tissue_model_weights.pth`
3. Download the cell model weights from [here]()
4. Place them in this directory with the filename `cell_model_weights.pth`

Then you can use the `process.py` script to run the algorithm in the same way it was run in the OCELOT Grand Challenge.
